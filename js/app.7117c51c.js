If you understood the title, CONGRATS YOU'RE A NERD! Let me start with a brief background on Python. Python is an open source programming language that was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum.It was made to look good and also be easy to read. I am taking a beginner's course in Python on Coursera. It is taught by Dr. Chuck at the University of Michigan. I am in the last week of the beginner's course, and after that, I will take additional courses taught by Dr. Chuck to supplement this one. As someone who is interested in computer engineering, I believe that it is important to introduce myself to various programming languages. I have chosen to start with Python and will continue to explore other languages as well.

I shared this idea with him, and he agreed! However, while I am not an experienced web developer, I dived into it, hoping to learn more as time went on. Step one would have been to make a functional website before hosting it online. Although I was aware of this crucial step, I skipped it. I was too excited to own a domain name and hoped that having a running website domain would motivate me to work faster on building the website. Once I had purchased a domain and had a domain hosting site, I went on to create a temporary page that provided the viewer with basic information such as the name of the company and contact information. I ended it with “Website Under Construction” so that I could update it as I further developed my skills.

Most of the articles had started off with a piece of advice: “Don’t be nervous. Just try new things.” And this is exactly where I was stuck. As a noob programmer, it was not a big deal to find new things to try, but getting myself to stop being so nervous was the main issue. This escalated even more when I saw a guy walk onto the bus with a box that seemed to hold a medium-sized piece of tech equipment. It was clear to see that this would be used for a hack. A few minutes later, a group of guys sitting next to me pulled out their laptops. After seeing that their screens were filled with color-coded code, I felt the need to take a deep breath and close my eyes. I didn’t open them until I was sure that there was nothing else around me that would daunt me. I felt so unprepared after seeing all this.
